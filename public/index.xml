      <description>Intro Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) plays a very important role in microservices oriented architectures.
RabbitMQ is one of the most famous message broker that uses AMQP 0.9.1 therefore I&amp;rsquo;m using this application for this short introduction.
AMQP relies on the concepts of Producers, Queues and Consumers, Exchange, Routes. One other common concept in this scope is Topics but it&amp;rsquo;s out of the intent of this intro.
Basic concepts Producer and consumer You can think a producer as an application that can send messages and a consumer as an application that can receive them.</description>
